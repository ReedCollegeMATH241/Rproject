### The Problem
The problem I decided to investigate is the question of how much Portland's famously crumby weather affects the sentiments expressed in tweets about the city.

## Disclaimer
I did not have enough data to actually try to attempt to draw any serious conclusions.

### Motivation
Twitter has become a ubiquitous means of self-expression which is entirely public. Thus more and more it has become a source of information about its users. At this point it has become so ubiquitous that nightly news often cites twitter data for vox populi type reporting. Working in media research this past summer I found that statistics about twitter were often used by producers to get a sense for audience engagement. However, many of these statistics were very basic like day-over-day percent-change in followers, numbers of retweets, and etc. These are basic reliable statistics, but in both journalism and consumer research there is also a lot of interest in getting a good cross-sectional read on what twitter users think about various subjects. And doing this computationally is a major challenge which ties into a number of areas which are attracting a lot of attention in data driven industries.
